***Welcome to Zhenlan's homepage!***

*<font size="2"><u>Updated on 5 Jan. 2023</u></font>*

I am currently a Second-year PhD student at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Shuai Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/).
Before joining HKUST, I received my B.S. degree from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China in 2021.

My research currently focuses on the application of **Causality Analysis**, and my research interests include 
**Software Engineering** and **Security**.
