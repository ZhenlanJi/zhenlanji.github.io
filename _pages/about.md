***Welcome to Zhenlan's homepage!***

*<font size="2"><u>Updated on 31 Mar. 2025</u></font>*

Zhenlan Ji is a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer
Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,
under the supervision of [Prof. Shuai
Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/). In 2021, he received his Bachelor's
degree in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University, Nanjing,
China. 
<!-- He has published papers at top-tier software engineering and security
venues like ICSE, focusing on the application of causality analysis.  -->
His research interests include **Software Engineering** and **Deep
Learning**, with a focus on **Causality** and **LLM-based Agents**.

Starting from Feb. 2025, he is taking a short-term visit to the
Momentum Lab at the University of Tokyo, Japan, under the supervision of
[Prof. Lei Ma](https://www.malei.org/).
