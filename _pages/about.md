***Welcome to Zhenlan's homepage!***

*<font size="2"><u>Updated on 25 Aug. 2023</u></font>*

Zhenlan Ji is currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer
Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,
under the supervision of [Prof. Shuai
Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/). In 2021, he received his Bachelor's
degree in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University, Nanjing,
China. 
<!-- He has published papers at top-tier software engineering and security
venues like ICSE, focusing on the application of causality analysis.  -->
His research interests include **Software Engineering**, **Security**, and
**Deep Learning**, with a focus on the application of **Causality
Analysis**.
